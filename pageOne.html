		<h2>
			<u>Halo: Combat Evolved</u>
		</h2>
		
		<img class="img1" src="halo.jpg">
		
		<p>
		Halo One is a classic game. It has an amazing storyline, and good cooperative modes. 
		</p>

		<h2>
			<u>Pokemon Soul Silver</u>
		</h2>
		
		<img class="img2" src="pokemon.jpg">
		
		<p>
		Pokemon Soul Silver is an amazing remake of Pokemon Gold and Silver. The Pokemon
		featured in the game are great. The connectivity functionality is also unreckoned 
		with. This is not mentioning that the legendary pokemon caught at the end, Lugia, 
		is an epic monster. I personally had good times with my buddies in the garage, 
		battling non-stop.

		<h2>
			<u>Gears of War 3</u>
		</h2>
		
		<img class="img3" src="gears.jpg">
		
		<p>
			Gears of War 3 had a decent campaign mode. However, it was well known for it's 
			multiplayer mode. It was a game that you could compete at or just enjoy with 
			friends. It easily earns a spot in my top 5 games of all time.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>
			<u>Destiny</u>
		</h2>
		
		<img class="img4" src="destiny.jpg">
		
		<p>
			Destiny fumbled a little at the start. However, it evolved into an amazing MMO. 
			One of the first of it's kinds. It was a game that, put simply, was competitvely 
			fun. Who didn't like waiting for Xer to pop up every Friday morning.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>
			<u>Dark Souls III</u>
		</h2>
		
		<img class="img5" src="souls.jpg">
		
		<p>
			Dark Souls III was expected to be just another Souls game. But, it blew it's 
			competition out of the waters. With outstanding gameplay, a fun online mode, and 
			who didn't like finally conquering a boss after their hundreth time.
